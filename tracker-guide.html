  <h2>Credit Card Payoff Tracker — Quick Input Guide</h2>

  <h3>1. Starting Balance</h3>
  <p>Enter the Total Amount Due from your latest credit card statement. Do not manually edit the balance after this.</p>

  <h3>2. Monthly Interest Rate</h3>
  <p>Input the monthly interest rate stated by your bank (example: 3%). Use monthly, not annual, rates.</p>

  <h3>3. Payment Amount</h3>
  <p>Enter the amount you plan to pay for the month. This should be at least the minimum amount due.</p>

  <h3>4. Payment Date</h3>
  <p>Use a consistent payment date every month. Earlier payments reduce interest and improve accuracy.</p>

  <h3>5. Expenses (If Included)</h3>
  <p>Input only fixed monthly obligations. Do not include one-time expenses or charges already included in your balance.</p>

  <h3>Common Errors to Avoid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Manually editing the total balance</li>
    <li>Entering payments twice</li>
    <li>Changing payment dates every month</li>
    <li>Mixing statement balance with current balance</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Update the tracker once per billing cycle and let it handle all calculations automatically.</p>
